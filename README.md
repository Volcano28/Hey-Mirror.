# Hey-Mirror.
My first repository on GitHub. Something new. Something good.

I did not know what programming was at the beginning but as soon as Ä± learned I liked it very much. Still thou, I remember feelin a little bit scared in the beginning. Because you know coding is hard. Not an easy task. Still manageable.
